# Personal Blog Salt
A work in process

Had some divergence so I forced a push so now everything's a bit more blank than I'd like.

This is my hackathon project for SALT. It's a personal blog. Here are the features I intend to implement in MOSCOW format:

```bash
• MUST: Have the ability to add blog posts to a database, 
search blog posts by id, 
blog posts must be sorted on the main page by date, in cards, 
clicking on a card must take you to the individual blog page. 
Must have About page (HTML only).

• Should: Have the ability to search for blog posts by title, 
should have the ability to delete blog posts by id, 
should have pagination on the main page, return 4 blog posts max per page. 
Be able to edit blog posts. Should be able to add tags/ keywords to the blogposts. 
Should be able to filter main page by keywords/tags. 
Should be able to search by keywords.

• Could: Have the ability to filter blog posts by date range. 
Have a login function/admin area 
(so only I can actually access the patch, post and delete functionalities). 
Have the blog posts have a cool expand transformation.

• Won’t: be able to replace blog posts
```
